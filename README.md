# Pneumonia Detection

This project focuses on detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques.

## Overview

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. This project aims to assist medical professionals in the early detection of pneumonia using chest X-ray images and machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Utilizes deep learning models to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or showing signs of pneumonia.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves a high level of accuracy in pneumonia detection.
- **Fast Processing**: Provides quick results to aid in timely diagnosis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhanush1-2/pneumonia-detection.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries. You can typically use:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your chest X-ray images in the designated input folder.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python pneumonia_detection.py
   ```
3. View the results in the output folder.

## Model

The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large dataset of chest X-ray images. The model architecture and training process are detailed in the `model.py` file.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is not included in this repository due to size constraints. Please refer to the `data_preparation.py` script for information on how to structure your data.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the model's accuracy or extend its functionality are welcome. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push to the branch.
5. Create a new Pull Request.
